Seeing the current state of the world in 2020, it was so saddening to see a major racism crisis arrive in the USA due to the death of George Floyd. Seeing the riots and the protests, I was very moved and wanted to show my support for the Black Lives Matter cause. Thus, the will to support the cause and stand against this inhuman act acted as an inspiration for me to create a filter that educates people about the cause and lets everyone participate in the cause without even leaving their homes in this pandemic.

# What it does?
This is a face filter that displays text like **Black Lives Matter**, **Power to People**, and more on the faces of people. The filter works on up to four people and shows different supportive text for different people. I also added colour-changing hearts which work as a symbol of love and support for the cause and the affected people. There is a ColourLUT filter which boosts the colour of the scene along with a dust filter which makes the scene a pretty sight to behold. The overall idea of this filter is to support the cause along with making the process creative and colourful.
