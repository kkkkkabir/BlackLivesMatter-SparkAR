# BlackLivesMatter-SparkAR
I created a face filter on the "Black Lives Matter" cause to show my support. I created this using SparkAR, Photoshop and Illustrator.
# What it does?
This is a face filter that displays text like **Black Lives Matter**, **Power to People**, and more on the faces of people. The filter works on up to four people and shows different supportive text for different people. I also added colour-changing hearts which work as a symbol of love and support for the cause and the affected people. There is a ColourLUT filter which boosts the colour of the scene along with a dust filter which makes the scene a pretty sight to behold. The overall idea of this filter is to support the cause along with making the process creative and colourful.
